# multimodal-complaint-analysis-system
This is a multimodal complaint analysis system that utilizes Vertex AI and Google Cloud, processing text, image, video or voice files and storing the analyzed complaint info into a PostgreSQL database. You will need to provide your own .env Gemini key and service account creditials. The application is intended to be a back end process, but includes a rudamentary front end for demo purposes. 

Note: the image, voice and video code *works* in the terminal, but does not run in the frontend yet because we are still figuring out how to parse some of the output data structures. We only had 3 hours to work on this project.
